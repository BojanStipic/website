    Hi! 👋 I'm <strong>Bojan</strong>. I'm a software engineer at <Link

      target="_blank">Symphony</Link
    >
    and a <Link href={GITHUB_PROFILE_URL} target="_blank">free software</Link> enthusiast
    and advocate. I currently work as a full stack web developer. I used to be a teaching
    assistant at the University of Novi Sad, Serbia, where my main focus was on systems
    programming, programming language design, and compiler development. I use Neovim
    and Arch Linux btw.
